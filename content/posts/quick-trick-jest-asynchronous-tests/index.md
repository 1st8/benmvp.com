- Jest has several ways to write tests for asynchronous code
- Sometimes we mess up and don't write the test correctly
  - Jest by default passes tests even if no assertions happen
  - Tests pass even though the test never runs your assertions
- There is `expect.hasAssertions` you can use to make sure a case ran at least one assertion
- Don't want to have to put that into _every_ test
- In Jest config you can add a `beforeEach` with `expect.hasAssertions()` and it'll run for **all** tests
- Be prepared, if you're adding it after the fact, you may have lots of tests to fix! ðŸ˜„
